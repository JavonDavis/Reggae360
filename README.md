This App is intended to serve the needs of Reggae (and in the future other caribbean genres) enthusiasts all around the world. The intention is for this app to be the centre point of interaction within the scope of caribbean music and entertainment by leveraging the existing JulyOne customer following and attracting more reggae fans to this virtual entertainment ecosystem.

The App is an hybrid app built upon the Angular.js & Ionic UI framework. The details of implementation for now can be found in the Slack group particularly the #app channel.
